For most communication, Piazza is preferred to email.
If you email, include "DSA2" at the beginning of the subject line to help us prioritize your email.

Our TAs are students too, with duties and work outside of their TAing. Please do not ask them to act as your TA except at the scheduled on-the-clock times they have listed as their office hours and lab time. They are also kind people; please don't put them in the position of having to say no or (worse) being nice to you at the expense of their own schooling.

### Course Meetings


### Practicing and Measuring Learning

Some tasks are designed to help you learn and practice what you learned enough that the concepts solidify in your mind.
Others are designed to measure what you have learned.
The primary kinds of tasks are:

#### Programming Assignments (PAs)

#### Problem Sets (PSs) 

#### In-Class Activities (ICs)

#### LaTeX Warm-up

#### Quizzes
- Quizzes will be in-class and must be taken in person.

### Textbook and Readings 


### Coding

> "If you really want to understand something, the best way is to try and explain it to someone else. That forces you to sort it out in your own mind. And the more slow and dim-witted your pupil, the more you have to break things down into more and more simple ideas. And that’s really the essence of programming. By the time you’ve sorted out a complicated idea into little steps that even a stupid machine can deal with, you’ve certainly learned something about it yourself."
> <div class="text-right">-Douglas Adams</div>

In this course, you are welcome to use Python or Java to complete your PAs.  We will provide starter code for both languages.  Please choose an IDE that you are comfortable working with (Eclipse, IntelliJ, PyCharm, VSCode, vim (if you're like Prof Hott), etc).  For each PA, you should thoroughly test your algorithms; we will provide some example test cases in the assignment descriptions, but you should devise your own tests to check edge and corner cases.

You will be asked to submit your code to Gradescope.  It is important to use a version of Python or Java that is compatible with our grading system.  Therefore, we **strongly suggest** using either:
- Python 3.10.6
- Java 19.0.2 (OpenJDK)

*If you choose to use a different version, please be sure that any classes, methods, language features you use are available in these versions.*

Estimating how long it will take someone to complete a coding assignment is always difficult.
The target difficulty is 5–10 hours of focused effort each week.

## Grading

### Grading Scale

We will use the standard grading scheme for this course.

|  Grade    |  Lower Bound    |

### Points per Activity Type

Points are awarded per task.
Different tasks and different task types are given different weight, as outlined below.

| Task        | Weight    |
|:------------|:---------:|
| Quizzes     |   50%     |
| PAs         |   20%     |
| PSs         |   25%     |
| ICs         |    5%     |

### Late Assignments

#### PA and PS Assignments

PAs and PSs may be submitted up to 48 hours late, with permission, with no grade penalty.  However, the following policies apply to late submission:
1. Requests must be submitted online using our [Extension Request Form]()
    - Requests must include a valid justification (such as SDAC accommodations, severe illness, religious observation, personal or family tragedy, etc)
    - Extension requests must be made **24 hours before** the deadline
    - Extension requests made **less than 24 hours before** the deadline must also include a valid reason why the extension request **could not** be requested earlier
1. Significant work must be submitted to Gradescope **before** the deadline for requests to be approved
1. No office hour assistance will be provided for an assignment *after* the due date

If extensions beyond the 48 hours grace period are needed, please see the professor **before the deadline** to discuss why and if other accommodations are also needed.

#### Quizzes 

Quizzes may not be taken late (or early) without special-case permission.

#### In-Class Activities

ICs are intended and expected to be completed in class.  We **will not** announce which days have in class activities in advance.  If you are sick or miss an in class activity, you may make it up **independently** outside of class, but you must submit it by **9am** on the second day.  *For example, if the in-class activity is on a Tuesday, you must submit by Thursday at 9am.*

## Professionalism

In this course, there will be a focus on working well together and learning. Students and staff are all expected to treat each other with respect. This includes, but certainly is not limited to:

- Misuse of class platforms (Discord, Piazza, YouTube comments, etc.)
- Disrespectful language or actions to course staff or other students
- Promptness for all deadlines and class meetings
- Quality work
- Not following University COVID-19 regulations or being mindful of others

Behave professionally.

Never abuse anyone, including the emotional abuse of blaming others for your mistakes.
Kindness is more important than correctness.

Let our TAs be students when they are not on the clock as TAs.

<!--Students can and will be penalized for unprofessional behavior.-->
**Consequences of Unprofessional Behavior**: Unprofessional behavior, such as misbehavior towards instructors, classmates, or TAs, or causing disctractions for other students, can be held against a student when final grades are calculated.  The penalty is up to 20% of the final course grade.

## Honesty

We always hope everyone will behave honestly.
We know we all are tempted to do what we ought not;
if you do something you regret, the sooner you tell us the sooner (and more leniently) we can correct it.

### No plagiarism (nor anything like it)

You **must** cite any and every source you consult, other than those explicitly provided by the course itself.
Talked to a friend, saw an interesting video, consulted a website, had a tutor?
Tell us!
Put it in a comment in your code or quiz.

### Write your own code

You must write your own code.
Not just type it (though you need to do that too): **compose it yourself**, as your own original work.

We ask you to program to help you learn the content covered in the programming assignment and to help you demonstrate to us your knowledge.
This is *unlike* industry, where you program to create a product.
Because it is your mind we are looking to help develop and measure, it is your mind that must do all the work.
Working with others is *not* OK.

Our TAs have been trained to provide help that does not undermine the primary purpose of helping you learn. Other people (tutors, fellow students, etc) have not. As such, you should not give help to your peers nor accept help from others besides course staff.

### Understand what you submit

Your understanding is the primary deliverable of our assignments, not the code itself.
As such, we may ask you to explain aspects of a solution you turn in,
and may dock points if it appears you simply copied someone else's ideas (or just guessed a lot of things until one worked) without understanding them.

### Do NOT share your code

You should not share any code from an individual assignment.  That means you should not push it to GitHub (or any other site), send a copy to a friend who "just needs help with the last part," turning your screen to your neighbor, coding up solutions together, etc.  We know that sometimes you have good intentions--and we've seen it before--but it may not always go the way you think, so please do NOT share your code with anyone.

### No help on quizzes or exams

It would probably go without saying if we didn't say it, but no assistance may be given or received on any supervised evaluation or online quiz unless specifically announced otherwise by the professor (or another proctor of the evaluation).

### Use of Generative AI Tools

Generative artificial intelligence tools—software that creates new text, images, computer code, audio, video, and other content—have become widely available. Well-known examples include ChatGPT for text and DALL•E for images. The course policy described here governs all such tools, including those released during our semester together. You may use generative AI tools on assignments in this course only when we explicitly permit you to do so. Otherwise, you should refrain from using such tools. 

If you do use generative AI tools on assignments in this class, you must properly document and credit the tools themselves. Cite each tool you used, in the form shown for a hypothetical tool:

    Intelligent Sage 3, version 3.1. Accessed from http://intelligentsage.com

Additionally, please include a brief description of how you used the tool. Please include the prompt or prompts you gave the tool. Failure to cite the use of the tool as a source is a serious violation of academic integrity.  

If you choose to use generative AI tools, please remember that they are typically trained on limited datasets that may be out of date. Additionally, generative AI datasets are trained on pre-existing material, including copyrighted material; therefore, relying on a generative AI tool may result in plagiarism or copyright violations. Finally, keep in mind that the goal of generative AI tools is to produce content that seems to have been produced by a human, not to produce accurate or reliable content; therefore, relying on a generative AI tool may result in your submission of inaccurate content. It is your responsibility—not the tool’s—to assure the quality, integrity, and accuracy of work you submit in any college course. 

If you use generative AI tools to complete assignments in this course, in ways that I have not explicitly authorized, we will apply the course's policies on academic integrity appropriate to your specific case. In addition, you must be wary of unintentional plagiarism or fabrication of data. Please act with integrity, for the sake of both your personal character and your academic record.

### Consequences of Dishonesty

If we believe you have acted dishonestly, including sharing or receiving code, we will communicate this fact to you and propose a penalty.
If you have information we lack, please share that with us; we may thereafter change our belief and/or proposed penalty.
Penalties may be up to and including a failing grade (F) in the course, *independent of and in addition to the operations of the Honor Code*.
- A typical first offense penalty: A zero (0) on the assignment in which the dishonesty or plagiarism occurred
- A typical second or later offense penalty: an automatic F in the course.

If the case is particularly egregious and beyond our comfort level handling in-course, we will refer the case to the University Honor System.

## Life

Bad things happen.
People forget things and make mistakes.
Bad days coincide with due dates.
etc.

If you believe that circumstances warrant an change in deadline, a second chance, or some other accommodation in order to more accurately synchronize grade with knowledge, come talk to your professor and we'll resolve the situation as best we can.

### Special Circumstances 
It is my goal to create a learning experience that is as accessible as possible. If you anticipate any issues related to the format, materials, or requirements of this course, please meet with me outside of class so we can explore potential options. Students with disabilities may also wish to work with the Student Disability Access Center (SDAC) to discuss a range of options to removing barriers in this course, including official accommodations. We are fortunate to have an SDAC advisor, Courtney MacMasters, physically located in Engineering. You may email her at [cmacmasters@virginia.edu](mailto:cmacmasters@virginia.edu) to schedule an appointment. For general questions please visit the SDAC website: [sdac.studenthealth.virginia.edu](http://sdac.studenthealth.virginia.edu/). If you have already been approved for accommodations through SDAC, please send me your accommodation letter and meet with me so we can develop an implementation plan together.

Since we are a large course, we ask that students with special circumstances let us know as soon as possible, preferably during the **first week of class**.

### Religious Accommodations 
It is the University's long-standing policy and practice to reasonably accommodate students so that they do not experience an adverse academic consequence when sincerely held religious beliefs or observances conflict with academic requirements.

Students who wish to request academic accommodation for a religious observance should submit their request in writing to me as far in advance as possible. If you have questions or concerns about academic accommodations for religious observance or religious beliefs may contact the [University's Office for Equal Opportunity and Civil Rights](https://eocr.virginia.edu/accommodations-religious-observance)  (EOCR) at [UVAEOCR@virginia.edu](mailto:UVAEOCR@virginia.edu) or 434-924-3200.  Accommodations do not relieve you of the responsibility for completion of any part of the coursework missed as the result of a religious observance.

### Safe Environment
The University of Virginia is dedicated to providing a safe and equitable learning environment for all students. 
If you or someone you know has been affected by power-based personal violence, more information can be found on the UVA Sexual Violence website that describes reporting options and resources available -- [www.virginia.edu/sexualviolence](www.virginia.edu/sexualviolence). 

The same resources and options for individuals who experience sexual misconduct are available for discrimination, harassment, and retaliation.  [UVA prohibits discrimination and harassment](https://uvapolicy.virginia.edu/policy/HRM-009) based on age, color, disability, family medical or genetic information, gender identity or expression, marital status, military status, national or ethnic origin, political affiliation, pregnancy (including childbirth and related conditions), race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, veteran status. [UVA policy](https://uvapolicy.virginia.edu/policy/HRM-010) also prohibits retaliation for reporting such behavior. 

If you witness or are aware of someone who has experienced prohibited conduct, you are encouraged to submit a report to [Just Report It](https://justreportit.virginia.edu) (justreportit.virginia.edu) or contact [EOCR](mailto:UVAEOCR@virginia.edu), the office of Equal Opportunity and Civil Rights.

If you would prefer to disclose such conduct to a confidential resource where what you share is not reported to the University, you can turn to [Counseling & Psychological Services](https://www.studenthealth.virginia.edu/caps) (CAPS) and [Women's Center Counseling Staff and Confidential Advocates](https://womenscenter.virginia.edu/confidential-advocates) (for students of all genders). 

As your professor and as a person, know that I care about you and your well-being and stand ready to provide support and resources as we can. As a faculty member, I am a responsible employee, which means that I am required by University policy and federal law to report certain kinds of conduct that you report to me to the University's Title IX Coordinator. The Title IX Coordinator's job is to ensure that the reporting student receives the resources and support that they need, while also determining whether further action is necessary to ensure survivor safety and the safety of the University community. 

### Well-being 
If you are feeling overwhelmed, stressed, or isolated, there are many individuals here who are ready and wanting to help. The Student Health Center offers Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) for all UVA students. Call 434-243-5150 (or 434-972-7004 for after hours and weekend crisis assistance) to get started and schedule an appointment. If you prefer to speak anonymously and confidentially over the phone, Madison House provides a HELP Line at any hour of any day: 434-295-8255.

### Support for Your Career Development 

Engaging in your career development is an important part of your student experience. For example, presenting at a research conference, attending an interview for a job or internship, or participating in an extern/shadowing experience are not only necessary steps on your path but are also invaluable lessons in and of themselves. I wish to encourage and support you in activities related to your career development. To that end, please notify me at least one-week in advance of such an event to arrange for appropriate accommodations.


## Student Support Team 

You have many resources available to you when you experience academic or personal stresses. In addition to your professor, the School of Engineering and Applied Science offers free tutoring, and has three staff members located in Thornton Hall who you can contact to help manage academic or personal challenges. Please do not wait until the end of the semester to ask for help!

Through this space, we affirm and empower equitable participation toward intercultural fluency and provide the resources necessary for students to be successful during their academic journey and future careers.

## Additional Notes

**Syllabus Note**: This syllabus is to be considered a reference document that may be adjusted throughout the course of the semester to address necessary changes. This syllabus can be changed at any time without notification; it is up to the student to monitor the website for news of any changes. Final authority on any decision in this course rests with the professor, not with this document.

**Research**: Your class work and related data might be used for research purposes. For example, we may use anonymized scores from student assignments to compare to other student performance data. Any student who wishes to opt out can contact the instructor or TA to do so *after* final grades have been issued. This has no impact on your grade in any manner.
